# Text Analysis Toolkit

An interactive **Text Analysis Toolkit** built with **Python** and **Tkinter**.  
This project provides an intuitive GUI to perform various **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tasks on text, including cleaning, summarization, sentiment analysis, word frequency, word clouds, and PDF export.  



##  Features
- **Language Detection** → Detects the language of the input text.  
- **Text Cleaning** → Lowercasing, punctuation removal, and stopword filtering.  
- **Word Frequency Analysis** → Displays the most frequent words.  
- **Text Summarization** → Extracts the most relevant sentences using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.  
- **Sentiment Analysis** → Uses `textblob_fr` with `PatternAnalyzer` to compute polarity and subjectivity.  
- **Word Cloud Generation** → Visualizes the most common words.  
- **Statistics** → Provides number of words and sentences.  
- **File Import** → Load text files for quick analysis.  
- **Export Results** → Save results as a PDF file.  
- **User-Friendly GUI** → Built with Tkinter for ease of use.
